              <strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of
              wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that
              responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's
              wheat.
            </li>

              <strong>2005</strong> - States "we will have to double the world
              food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are
              the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
              Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've
              been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.
              Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best
              breeds."
